    <p1>I have registered myself for the Toronto half marathon which will be taking place on May 1 2022. 
      It has always been a goal of mine to eventually run a full marathon, however I thought I would work 
      my way up there and start with half of one. </p1>
<br>
<br>
      <p2> To properly prepare I have been tracking my run lengths and time since December 2021 and will be doing
          so until the Marathon. It must be noted that although I do not track it, 
        I swim quite frequetly. This adds to the level of fitness I am trying to reach.  </p2>
