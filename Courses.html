      <p1>There I was, moving into Saint Jeromes University College, my dorm room for the next 8 months of my life. The math programs
        at The University of Waterloo was one of the only programs that was offering in person 
       classes despite the pandemic. I decided to move to Waterloo and start my university adventure even with having the option
       of taking online courses and staying home. To this day, I suspect that in person courses were offered because the two first math classes math majors need to take
       Math135 and Math137 are so deadly that they wanted to give extra support to students. Of course, this is just a speculation.
       </p1>
       <br>
       <br> 
       <p2> The beginning of 1A was very rough. As mentionned, Math135 and Math137 started 
           slowly but surely becoming most of first year math majors primary nightmare. Math135 is an 
           introduction to proofs course and Math137 is first year calculus course.  Both courses 
           were extremely interesting but diffficult. As time passed by and post-midterm, the 
           initial shock that us barely graduated Highschoolers had gotten was starting to cool down. 
           Cs115 was a programming course, the first one I had even taken. It was interesting and I had 
           fun. Some assignments took forever to figure out and finish but I got through it. At Laurier, 
           I had to take an introduction to Business course Bu111, and Ec120. Bu111 has 
           mixed reviews depending on who you ask. Some enjoy it some dont. I am part of the latter. 
           Ec120, intro to microeconomics, I very much enjoyed. It was an engaging course with an engaging prof. 
           My first ever economics course and probably my favourite course in 1A.

      <p3> 1B... Mentally, this was my worst semester. I had just finished 1A 
        which tore me apart in terms of difficulty. Christmas break I was looking
        ahead to what seemed like hell. I had major imposter syndrome in 1A
        and did not know if Double Degree was my right program. Usually
        in 1B, Double Degree's overload. We take Math136,Math138,Cs116,Spcom223, Bu121 
        and Ec140. After barely surviving 1A I did not want to add a sixth course. So
        I started the semester with all but Math136. The original plan
        was to take that in summer during co-op. My first week of school in 
        January we had gotten back into a major lockdown similar to March 2020. 
        The couple classes I did have in person were canceled. I was
        talking to advisors trying to figure out if this program was for me. I wanted to 
        switch out completely and head to science, the advisor suggested to drop a course 
        and take a science course. If I liked it more, I would leave the program, if I did not 
        like it I would stay. I thought to myself there is no way I will prefer my program to science, 
        but let's listen to the expert.

      And, thank god I did. The biology course I had taken instead of my computer science
      course was okay. However I would oftern be listening to the lectures and be
      thinking to myself yea, this is cool but I rather study Math! I learned 
      very early in the semester that I was at the right place and I had to get over myself and
      the imposter syndrome I thought of constantly.  1B was also the first term ever applying to Co-op. I ended up getting CIBC! My original 
      plan of taking Math136 during the summer changed. I wanted something new, I decided 
      to take a second year course, Stat230.

      My first summer as a university student was nothing as I imagined. I worked at my first ever 
      co-op at CIBC as an analyst, took a Mathematics Course, Stat230 and was part of the DOuble Degree Club. It
      was less intense than 1A and 1B definetly but nonetheless not a typical summer at all.

      Motivation was high however. I knew for sure that this was the program built for 
      me. I was behind compared to most of my peers. I knew I had to get through the statistic
      course, there was literally no other option. I ended up loving Stat230. Probabibility was 
      very different from calculus or proofs. It was refreshing doing math that I really did enjoy. 
      My co-op also went great. I met some very cool students at CIBC and had mentors that supported me, 
      were funny and believed in me. The Double Degree Club was also a great experience. I 
      finally felt like I did belong as a univeristy Math major. However I knew that even by taking this course 
      I was still behing. The decision to overload in 2A was taken during the summer.

    2A was a great term. Firstly, I knew I belonged in the program. The stakes were high but 
    I knew I was meant to be here. 3 of my 6 courses were first year courses, 1 of those every Double Degree 
    student takes, the other 2 being the two courses I had yet not taken. As mentionned, I had decided to take 
    Stat230 in the summer instead of Math136 to get a different taste of math. I loved the 
    course so much I wanted to take a continuation of it, Stat231. I was also very excited because the 
    Professor, Michael Wallace had great reviews. The course I loved and it convinced me to pursue Statistics as 
    a major. The other two Waterloo courses I took were Cs116 and Math136. Cs116 was a great course, I learned to 
    code Python, a skill I always wanted. Math136 was probably the course I spent the least on. This 
    being because something had to give, since I overloaded, and this course was the one I took a hit on. 
    At Laurier, I took Bu283, Bu288 and Bu127. Bu283 was extremely interesting, especiallu the end of the course
    we learned about options and futures and I am excited to take the continuation of this course. Bu288 was not my 
    favourite. It is an organization behaviour course which was basically a psychology course. I had taken
    IB psychology back in highscool and most of the content I knew already. Bu127, accounting was one of my favourite 
    second year courses, probably tied with Stat231. I really enjoyed accounting, as weird as that is to say.

  All in all 2A was so good mentally because of the balance! I learned to be able to juggle school, friends, clubs, sports 
    and personal time! I know, crazy!!! The original plan was to take CO250 on co-op, but as most of the original plan in regards to course progression
    has gone, that also did not end up happening. Math235, linear Algebra 2 was the course I ended up taking.
